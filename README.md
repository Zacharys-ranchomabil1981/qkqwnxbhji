Oh man, just finished watching Jumbo, and I’ve gotta say, that was something else. You ever just stare at your screen wondering what the actual heck is going on? Like, I kinda get it, but then I’m also just... why tho? The whole thing felt like a two-hour fever dream. But, in a good way? I think? 😂

Seriously though, that carousel scene. I mean, it’s a whole machine romance thing which, honestly, had me questioning life choices, you know what I mean? I half expected someone to yell “cut” and tell us we’re all being punked. But no, we just keep rolling with it. 

Haha, but the visuals were pretty dope after you download the movie. They have this trippy, sorta hauntingly beautiful vibe. Like, every time the lights flickered, I was convinced it held the secrets of the universe or something. Honestly had me wishing I went for the 3D glasses, but hey, the couch was way too comfy to leave.

> And the actress, let’s talk about her! She just goes all in, right? Like, full-on commitment to this bizarre love affair with a freakin’ park ride. You gotta respect that. Made me think she could probably sell me sand in a desert. Not gonna lie, I didn’t see much else of the cast, but she kept the whole thing afloat, you know?

Anyway, watching her make eyes at a fairground machine kept me hooked. There’s irony in it too, right? Falling for something that’s designed to be temporary, here for the customers’ thrill ride, but she builds this, I dunno, connection. I mean, it’s weird but kinda deep if you squint your eyes just right.

  console.log(Seriously, I have no clue.);
}

Oh! And the soundtrack!! Ugh, I forgot to mention. Absolutely nailed it. I caught myself humming a couple of tunes while wondering what snacks I was missing out on. But, what’s watching the movie without a big ol' tub of popcorn anyway? 😂

Anyway, I’m done for the night. Gonna let the chaos of that film settle in my brain. Let’s catch up soon, yeah?
